## Running Picodata

Running a Picodata instance only takes one simple command:

```bash
picodata run
```

Getting a basic distributed cluster made of two instances running on
different hosts involves two commands, like this:

```bash
picodata run --listen 192.168.0.1:3301 --pg-listen 192.168.0.1:5432
picodata run --listen 192.168.0.2:3301 --pg-listen 192.168.0.2:5432 --peer 192.168.0.1:3301
```

You can find out more about getting started procedures and first steps
by heading to [docs.picodata.io].
