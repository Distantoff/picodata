# Picodata â€“  Distributed, PostgreSQL-compatible in-memory database

This repository contains the source code of Picodata, a distributed
in-memory database with plugins in Rust.

## What is Picodata

Picodata is a PostgreSQL-compatible distributed DBMS with plugins
in Rust. It is based on [shared-nothing architecture] and partitions the
entire data set across independent processes each running on an own CPU core.
Picodata is SQL- and wire-compatible with PostgreSQL.

## Running Picodata

Running a Picodata instance only takes one simple command:

```bash
picodata run
```

Getting a basic distributed cluster made of two instances running on
different hosts involves two commands, like this:

```bash
picodata run --listen 192.168.0.1:3301 --pg-listen 192.168.0.1:5432
picodata run --listen 192.168.0.2:3301 --pg-listen 192.168.0.2:5432 --peer 192.168.0.1:3301
```

documentation site at [docs.picodata.io].
